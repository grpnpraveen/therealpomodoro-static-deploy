🎨 Designing the Pomodoro Universe: A Figma Journey! 🖌️

Hello, creative minds! 👋 As we continue the exciting adventure of crafting a 3D Pomodoro experience using Blender and Three.js, it's time to pull back the curtain on the Figma process. Designing the user interface and experience is a crucial part of this project, and Figma has been my trusty companion throughout. Here's a peek into the design phase. 

1. Selecting the Color Palette 🎨
 I carefully curated a color palette that enhances focus and creativity. In Figma, I explored various combinations until I found the perfect blend that complements the immersive 3D environment. Each color was chosen not only for its visual appeal but also to promote a calming and productive atmosphere during work sessions.

2.Creating Components and Designing Webpages 🖌️
To ensure a seamless and consistent user experience, I delved into creating components in Figma. These reusable design elements streamline the process and maintain visual coherence across the entire Pomodoro platform.

With components in place, I started designing the webpages for the home, about, and contact sections.

Home Page: 
The central hub where users initiate their Pomodoro sessions. It showcases the 3D model, the timer, and a welcoming interface to kickstart productivity.

About Page: 
A detailed guide on how to effectively use the Pomodoro Technique. This section not only educates users on the method but also provides insights into the how to have a proper productive day.

Contact Page:
 An avenue for users to reach out, share feedback, or connect. Whether you have questions, suggestions, or just want to say hello, this page is designed to foster communication within the Pomodoro community.
